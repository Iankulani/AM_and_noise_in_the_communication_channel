# AM_and_noise_in_the_communication_channel
This repository demonstrates the concept of Amplitude Modulation (AM) and the impact of noise on a communication channel. It focuses on how AM signals are transmitted and how noise, typically modeled as random interference, can affect the quality and integrity of the signal during transmission.
